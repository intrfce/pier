# Pier

Pier is an opinionated derivative of [Laravel Sail](https://github.com/laravel/sail), providing a Docker powered local development experience for Laravel that is compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux. Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Pier. Pier's simple CLI means you can start building your Laravel application without any previous Docker experience.

## Official Documentation
